# Soccer Image Gallery

This is the landing webpage for an image gallery that showcases various images related to soccer. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## What I learned while making this project

- Learned how to make a responsive navigation bar
- Used pseudo classes to make the webpage more interactive
- Made sure the navigation bar turns into a drop down menu in case the menu options do not fit on the active window.
- Use media queries to make the web page more responsive.
- Used many transitions to improve the style of the webpage.
